# A 100$ JOURNEY: unveiling Bitcoin's Growth and Public Sentiment

## Abstract
Our assignment aims to reveal the law of Bitcoin price trends through comparative analysis and sentiment analysis. As a digital asset with high volatility and market influence, Bitcoin's price is driven by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic changes, policy dynamics, and public sentiment. Through data collection and analysis, we will explore the relationship between social sentiment and price fluctuations, and reveal how emotional changes affect Bitcoin's market performance.
At the same time, the study will reveal historical ups and downs data and sentiment trends respectively to find the correlation between Bitcoin price factors. The results surprised us. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated significantly in the past ten years, and it is positively correlated with people's positive comments.

## Data Collecting, Cleaning and Processing 
For the project assignment, I integrated the coursework from both Cloud Technologies and Data Management and Visualization into a single comprehensive project. In the Cloud Technologies component, I focused on AWS Cloud Computing, leveraging an EMR (Elastic MapReduce) environment with three nodes to process data using PySpark. 


## AWS configuration
The most challenging part in the initial phase of the project was the AWS configuration process. I set up three nodes in the EMR environment: a Main Node, a Core Node, and a Worker Node, all configured as m5.xlarge instances. For details on the required libraries and configuration methods, please refer to the configure.md file in the project directory.
