# A 100$ JOURNEY: unveiling Bitcoin's Growth and Public Sentiment
For the project assignment, I integrated the coursework from both Cloud Technologies and Data Management and Visualization into a single comprehensive project. During the data management and visualization stage, I primarily used Tableau to create visualizations based on the dataset derived from the processing phase. Specifically, for ranking bar charts, I initially created the animations using Tableau and then performed more detailed adjustments—such as changes in year progression and x-axis transitions—using the Adobe Premiere editing software.

## Abstract
Our assignment aims to reveal the law of Bitcoin price trends through comparative analysis and sentiment analysis. As a digital asset with high volatility and market influence, Bitcoin's price is driven by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic changes, policy dynamics, and public sentiment. Through data collection and analysis, we will explore the relationship between social sentiment and price fluctuations, and reveal how emotional changes affect Bitcoin's market performance. At the same time, the study will reveal historical ups and downs data and sentiment trends respectively to find the correlation between Bitcoin price factors. The results surprised us. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated significantly in the past ten years, and it is positively correlated with people's positive comments.
